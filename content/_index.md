# no list
at the moment i want a static start page 

if i ever start to blog [/post](/post/) will be the better place

at the moment im just playing with hugo (the tool that builds this site)

## Todos:
- [ ] add, a "last changed by: $date" at the end of every page
- [ ] find/create a theme that is more useful for non-blogs
  - this feels wrong:
  - ```cd layouts && cp ../themes/blackburn/layouts/_default/single.html index.html```
